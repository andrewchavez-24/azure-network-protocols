<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Observe ICMP Traffic
- Observe SSH Traffic
- Observe DHCP Traffic
- Observe DNS Traffic
- Observe RDP Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p><b>Before getting started:</b> Create two VMs in the Azure portal: one using a Windows 10 Pro image and the other using a Linux image, each with 2 vCPUs. Ensure both VMs are attached to the same virtual network during setup. Use RDP to access the Windows machine.</p>

<h3>Install Wireshark</h3>
<p>Within your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, download and install Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org. This tool will be used to observe network traffic.</p>
